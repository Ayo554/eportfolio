The OWASP Threat Modeling Cookbook and the ATTACK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) libraries are valuable resources for organizations to enhance their threat modeling practices.

The OWASP Threat Modeling Cookbook provides a structured approach to threat modeling, offering step-by-step guidance on how to identify, analyze, and mitigate potential threats. It includes practical examples, templates, and techniques to help organizations effectively incorporate threat modeling into their risk management processes.

On the other hand, the ATTACK libraries are a comprehensive collection of known adversary behaviors, tactics, and techniques. They provide organizations with a wealth of information on how attackers operate, enabling them to identify potential vulnerabilities and design effective mitigations. The libraries cover a wide range of areas, including network attacks, web application attacks, and social engineering techniques.

By leveraging these resources, organizations can gain a deeper understanding of their threat landscape, identify potential weaknesses in their systems, and implement appropriate countermeasures. This proactive approach helps organizations stay ahead of potential threats and enhance their overall security posture<!DOCTYPE HTML>

										<h2>Unit 1</h2>
									</header>
									<p>We were set up as a team to read the (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019) as the basis of our chosen case study in the collaborative discussion I, and over the next three weeks, discuss and comment on issues raised by other team members.
This unit’s focus was for us to individually read the case study and report on the types of risk identified, and reference to corroborate or the author’s stand.
This case study illustrates some of the risks around applying digitalisation to more traditional business processes, as well as providing a methodology for carrying out the risk assessment of the digitalisation process.
One example of a risk related to data value and cybersecurity is a data breach in a financial institution. In 2017, Equifax, one of the largest credit reporting agencies, suffered a massive data breach that exposed sensitive personal information of approximately 147 million individuals. The breach not only resulted in financial losses for Equifax but also exposed individuals to identity theft and financial fraud, highlighting the importance of robust cybersecurity measures and the value of protecting customer data.

Another example of a risk related to function criticality and scalability of failure is a system failure in critical infrastructure. In 2018, the Atlanta city government experienced a ransomware attack that crippled several key systems, including the court system, public safety operations, and even the payment processing for water bills.

									<h4>Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process</h4>
									<p>
Still maintaining our team, this task required that we evaluated the authors’ use of quantitative and qualitative assessment approaches. Secondly, we had to give the advantages of involving users in the risk management process, and examine its effect on the choice of assessment method. Lastly, we had to give peer responses to at least, 2 peers’ posts.
This unit gave the team the opportunity to review and reflect on the Risk Management Process and discuss the importance of assessment approaches and user involvement in the RMP. 
The authors’ use of interviews as a means of data collection, gave a qualitative assessment of the security risks inherent in information systems, and without this, there wouldn’t have been sufficient data with which to carry out the quantitative analysis. It also provided context upon which the research was built. 
The quantitative methods employed include calculation of variance and hypothesis testing. These methods ensured the results obtained from the research gave more precise definitions of theoretical concepts as well as giving empirical results which revealed theoretical relationships that may have been missed otherwise.
This clearly shows that lack of user access during risk assessment will reduce the valuable feedback that could have been gotten if there was access to users, as users help provide context and share experience on the use of systems and vulnerabilities experience. 
The peer review was both an avenue to critique a colleague’s work as it was an opportunity to pitch my analysis against that of a peer. This was an interesting practice as it revealed a vital point I overlooked in the definition of the Industry 4.0.
My team had an extensive discussion which was both interactive and enlightening as [teammate…. or] both of my team mates shared personal experiences which elaborated on the need to understand both the quantitative and qualitative assessment approaches to risk assessment and management. Either of the approaches can be used independently with varying strengths, but a hybrid has proven to be of immense value as it gave a more comprehensive analysis, although it was time-consuming to collect and analyze.
This exercise reinforced the need to have interdisciplinary blend in teams, as we were able to draw from various experiences to give a proper analysis of the assessment approaches.
Subsequently, I’ve learned to ensure my analysis is not lopsided, with a bias to either quantitative or qualitative analysis without committing a fair devotion to both analysis. [Teammate…]’s experience of... also taught the team on the need for …, which I hope to incorporate in my future analysis of …

										<h2>Unit 3</h2>
									</header>
									<h4>Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management</h4>
									<p>
In this unit, we discussed the differences between threats and vulnerabilities and got introduced to a number of threat modelling techniques, to the end of understanding which technique to be applied in specific solutions.
As a team, we completed the collaborative discussion by presenting a “Summary Post”, which was a complete report on the case study under review.
The lecturecast comprised of comprehensive sessions on threats and vulnerabilities, including popular threat modelling techniques such STRIDE and DREAD, Attack Trees and hybrid models such as the Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA).
Shevchenko et. al (2018) expatiated on the methods available for threat modelling in a structured manner. Each method was carefully outlined, with an historical background on the technique, data flow diagrams showing the areas of vulnerability, and a breakdown of threat stages involved in the threat modelling framework. They also concluded with a feature table to assist in making a choice of what method is best suited to what threat.
This ensured that security professionals and beginners alike, can utilize the material in their day-to-day act of securing software and networks against unauthorized access and other threats.
In my contribution to the Module Wiki page, the acronym CAPEC was added, which means Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification. This was a term I had not come across before in my study of threat modelling. 

The experience of developing a summary note on the last three (3) weeks’ engagements and collaborative discussions helped us engage the learning content as well as responses from other peers, as we needed 
STRIDE appears to be one of the most widely used threat modelling technique and for obvious reasons; it contains a wide range of conceivable threats and vulnerabilities known in the security world. However, exposure to this unit has revealed a host of other threats that are available to unauthorized users, and also widened my knowledge on the various threat modelling techniques available to mitigate these threats.
This knowledge makes it easier to protect security systems against threats and vulnerabilities.

										<h2>Unit 5</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This unit engaged our ability to analyze industry specific security standards and how they affect risk assessments.
We explored security standards such as GDPR, and how they can be incorporated in threat modelling.
Case Study: Data Breach at an Online Retailer (2016)
In July 2016, a report was received from an online sales organization, which showed there had been a breach of the security on the payment system of their website. This breach resulted in the fraudulent use of the credit card details of a customer.
This addresses the Integrity and Confidentiality aspect of GDPR, which states that “personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage”, as well as the Accountability aspect which states that “The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR.”
It was considered that the organization had contravened the data protection acts by failing to take appropriate security measures against unauthorized access or unauthorized alteration of its Users’ personal data, and recommendations were made to that regard. The issue was resolved when the organization put new contracts in place to ensure that appropriate technical security measures were set up on their systems, they carried out regular reviews of their server and website platforms, and also carried out annual reviews by a third party expert to ensure compliance and validate their technical security.

This was a typical case study that highlighted the need for organizations to be held responsible for what happens on their platforms. Organizations should look beyond the profit they stand to gain from customers, and be actively involved in the security of customer personal data collected during transactions. This accountability will ensure there are right measures in place at all times.
Personally, lessons were learned to the tone of taking responsibility for the responsible use and protection of personal data collected for transactional purposes. This case study will be referred to when discussing with clients on the need to have security measures put in place as a crucial aspect of the ecommerce system.

										<h2>Unit 6</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Similar to Unit 5, this unit examined a few more case studies and how they relate to specific risk standards.
Coming from Nigeria, I have a few cases where organizations have been so complacent about the handling of user personal data, especially, in small and medium scale organizations, often resulting in the unchecked access to personal and sometimes, confidential data of clients and staff alike.
Sorensen (2018) did a good job in balancing both sides of the coin of digitalization. The tone of the article points at an optimist and digital enthusiast, who sees the possibilities that digitalization brings and how they can be harnessed, yet, who is not carried away by the awesomeness of the algorithms so as to ignore the threats it could pose if unchecked.
Citing an example of online price fixing, where the US department of justice prosecuted two retailers for aligning their pricing algorithm to take advantage of users. This study reveals the need for technical security measures to be put in place across different levels of engagement, to ensure data protection is considered paramount in the changing world of increasing vulnerabilities in the online space.
The standards are well drafted and functional documents, addressing different aspects of security and risk assessments from user engagement, to use of devices and platforms. This shows that the authors of these documents have been very thorough in their research of possible threats and vulnerabilities systems are open to, and have put these policies and standards in place to mitigate the risks posed by weak and vulnerable systems.

Reference
Sørensen, B.T., 2018. Digitalisation: an Opportunity or a Risk?. Journal of European Competition Law & Practice, 9(6), pp.349-350.
It is important that standards are put in place internationally, and compliance ensured, with sanctions placed on defaulters, and organizations held accountable for the use, and subsequent release or destruction of user data. Furthermore, there should be a synergy between the Information Technology world and legal and ethical practice, to ensure that all areas of human technological needs are met without trails that could cause damage to users of technology.
Regulatory bodies need to be setup at certain points of interaction, which oversee the compliance of organizations to standards and policies put in place.
Another recommendation would be that individuals should pay more attention to how their personal data is collected, used, and destroyed or released after transactions and engagements with organizations, personal, or public facilities.

										<h2>Unit 7</h2>
									</header>
									<p>An introduction to Quantitative Risk Modelling by exploring common models to find a common ground between their functionalities, as well as identify their peculiarities in assessing risks. 
This was followed by a second collaborative discussion on the use of Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which was to last for another 3 weeks, involving an initial post, review of peers’ contribution, and a final summary post.

Quantitative models bring the values to the forefront and help give a mathematical backing to the need for risk management. By putting figures on risks, decision making is made easier by simple comparison of the values assigned to each vulnerability or threat identified.
Being a probabilistic model, the Bayes theorem brings to mind the idea of looking beyond the technicalities, and limiting the assumptions, but quantifies the likelihood of having a threat given the measures in place or the possibilities within reach in the system.
Monte Carlo is a statistical model that balances optimism and pessimism. While focusing more weight on likelihood, it gives room for exploration of the extremes in its analysis and management of risk as risk is as much as sentimental affair as it is an empirical discuss.
In addition to the Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), these are 3 powerful tools for quantifying the risk exposure of a system, to explore the management techniques that can be implemented to mitigate the risks.

While quantitative methods give a robust and succinct analysis of risks which should make decision making easier, there exists some defects. In their critical review of the Analytic Hierarchy Process and Analytic Network Process, Asadabadi et al justified the need for further research into the validity of Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods, as intuitive methods are sometimes easier to adopt for decision making. It was also recommended that the deficiencies of MCDM methods be analyzed as it would be a letdown to go through the analysis required to obtain values for the risk assessment, only to realize the inaccuracies in the coefficients.
Risk analysis is an important subject that requires that both qualitative and quantitative measures are considered to ensure threats are checked and mitigated.
