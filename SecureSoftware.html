								<p>In this module, we’ll take an in depth look at the security risks which are associated with programming languages, from the perspectives of design and architecture approaches,
                  programming paradigms, testing, the impact and implications of operating systems and libraries on software development, the security risks associated with
                  distributed systems and APIs, and future trends in secure software and systems design. Running through these topics will be the concept of the secure software development life cycle.<br></p>

											<h4>Collaborative Discussion: UML Flowchart</h4>
											<p>Discussion Topic</p>
											<p>Open source tools are available to create UML diagrams, some are listed below. This list is not exhaustive. The benefit of using such tools is that they ensure that the recognised UML components are used to represent the parts of the model correctly.

    												<ul>
													<li>Visual Paradigm</li>
													<li>Sequence Diagram</li>
													<li>Umbrello</li>
												</ul>
											Choose an open-source UML tool from the list above.  Select one of the coding weaknesses which have been identified by OWASP and create a flowchart of the steps which may have led to the weakness occurring. Which UML models might you use to present the design of your proposed software, and why are they the most appropriate choice(s)?</p>

												<h3>Unit 3 - Introduction to Programming Languages </h3>
											</header>
											<h4>Development Team Project: Design Document</h4>
											<p>Project Brief:</p>
											<p>There have recently been a number of accusations of copying and copyright infringement in the music industry. Several industry stakeholders and performers have <br>
												suggested that a digital application is required to manage copyright material and to ensure that writers and performers rights are protected.<br>
												You have been commissioned to design an application that can be used as a secure enclave to store lyrics, music scores and musical recordings <br>
												(e.g. digital audio in formats such as MP3, FLAC and so on) on behalf of copyright owners and performers. It should provide a database to store the artefacts, <br>
												be able to generate a checksum to confirm the integrity of the artefact, the ability to encrypt the artefacts while they are stored, plus a mechanism <br>
												to generate and store time stamps that can be used to record creation and modification dates and times. The application should support different roles <br>
												such as administrators that can create and delete artefacts, and users that can add, view and modify their own entries and view but cannot modify those of others.<br><br>
												Your design should be captured using a UML tool and should consist of at least three different types of UML diagrams. <br>
												Your submission will be graded on the quality of the design, plus how well it adheres to UML standards and conventions. <br>
										</Br>It should detail the design of the database, data structures and data flows as well as application details expressed as a class diagram. <br>
											Your design should demonstrate an effective working knowledge of object-oriented design principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction, amongst others.</p>

											<h4>Developing an API for a Distributed Environment</h4>
											<p>Activity brief:</p>
											<p>In this session, you will create a RESTful API which can be used to create and delete user records. Responses to the questions should be recorded in your e-portfolio.<br>
												You are advised to use these techniques to create an API for your team’s submission in Unit 6. <br>
												Using the Jupyter Notebook workspace, create a file named api.py and copy the following code into it </p>

											<h4>Development Individual Project - Coding Output</h4>
											<p>Project brief:</p>
											<p>You are now required to implement the application which you designed in Unit 3.<br>
												This should be written in Python and should not use or be based on commonly available frameworks such as Django, Flask and so on. <br>
												It should be a command line interface application. In addition, you should explain and justify the use of external libraries and <br>
												code that account for more than 20% of your application, marks will be deducted for over-reliance on external libraries or code. <br>
												For example – do not use frameworks such as Django where your original code would usually comprise much less than 30% of the overall code.<br><br>
												You should add comments to your code, which illustrate, amongst other qualities, how your application implements the design patterns you created in the Unit 3 Assignment.<br>
												The implementation should illustrate CRUD functionality – i.e., how to create, read, update, and delete artefacts. It should also provide and demonstrate multiple roles <br>
												such as administrator and user.<br><br>
												The main purpose of this assessment is to implement a secure application, so emphasis should be placed on secure coding practices and <br>
												procedures, including the use of security testing applications; marks will be awarded for evidence of the use of such tools.</p>
