									<h4>Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process</h4>
									<p>
Still maintaining our team, this task required that we evaluated the authors’ use of quantitative and qualitative assessment approaches. Secondly, we had to give the advantages of involving users in the risk management process, and examine its effect on the choice of assessment method. Lastly, we had to give peer responses to at least, 2 peers’ posts.
This unit gave the team the opportunity to review and reflect on the Risk Management Process and discuss the importance of assessment approaches and user involvement in the RMP. 
The authors’ use of interviews as a means of data collection, gave a qualitative assessment of the security risks inherent in information systems, and without this, there wouldn’t have been sufficient data with which to carry out the quantitative analysis. It also provided context upon which the research was built. 
The quantitative methods employed include calculation of variance and hypothesis testing. These methods ensured the results obtained from the research gave more precise definitions of theoretical concepts as well as giving empirical results which revealed theoretical relationships that may have been missed otherwise.
This clearly shows that lack of user access during risk assessment will reduce the valuable feedback that could have been gotten if there was access to users, as users help provide context and share experience on the use of systems and vulnerabilities experience. 
The peer review was both an avenue to critique a colleague’s work as it was an opportunity to pitch my analysis against that of a peer. This was an interesting practice as it revealed a vital point I overlooked in the definition of the Industry 4.0.
My team had an extensive discussion which was both interactive and enlightening as [teammate…. or] both of my team mates shared personal experiences which elaborated on the need to understand both the quantitative and qualitative assessment approaches to risk assessment and management. Either of the approaches can be used independently with varying strengths, but a hybrid has proven to be of immense value as it gave a more comprehensive analysis, although it was time-consuming to collect and analyze.
This exercise reinforced the need to have interdisciplinary blend in teams, as we were able to draw from various experiences to give a proper analysis of the assessment approaches.
Subsequently, I’ve learned to ensure my analysis is not lopsided, with a bias to either quantitative or qualitative analysis without committing a fair devotion to both analysis. [Teammate…]’s experience of... also taught the team on the need for …, which I hope to incorporate in my future analysis of …

									<h4>Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management</h4>
									<p>
In this unit, we discussed the differences between threats and vulnerabilities and got introduced to a number of threat modelling techniques, to the end of understanding which technique to be applied in specific solutions.
As a team, we completed the collaborative discussion by presenting a “Summary Post”, which was a complete report on the case study under review.
The lecturecast comprised of comprehensive sessions on threats and vulnerabilities, including popular threat modelling techniques such STRIDE and DREAD, Attack Trees and hybrid models such as the Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA).
Shevchenko et. al (2018) expatiated on the methods available for threat modelling in a structured manner. Each method was carefully outlined, with an historical background on the technique, data flow diagrams showing the areas of vulnerability, and a breakdown of threat stages involved in the threat modelling framework. They also concluded with a feature table to assist in making a choice of what method is best suited to what threat.
This ensured that security professionals and beginners alike, can utilize the material in their day-to-day act of securing software and networks against unauthorized access and other threats.
In my contribution to the Module Wiki page, the acronym CAPEC was added, which means Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification. This was a term I had not come across before in my study of threat modelling. 

The experience of developing a summary note on the last three (3) weeks’ engagements and collaborative discussions helped us engage the learning content as well as responses from other peers, as we needed 
STRIDE appears to be one of the most widely used threat modelling technique and for obvious reasons; it contains a wide range of conceivable threats and vulnerabilities known in the security world. However, exposure to this unit has revealed a host of other threats that are available to unauthorized users, and also widened my knowledge on the various threat modelling techniques available to mitigate these threats.
This knowledge makes it easier to protect security systems against threats and vulnerabilities.
