										<h2>Unit 1 - 3 - Introduction to Research Methods. The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing</h2>
									</header>
									<p> To be discussed: 
										From late 2022, generative AI has taken the world by storm, and there is no field of activity that has <br>
										not been impacted in some way. This is so much truer for Computer Science, which is where it all began. <br>
										It is important to realise, however, that AI itself is nothing new, per se; and if the renaissance of the field <br>
										after the ‘winter’ of the 1980s has been slow but constant, today there is the need of a different set of rules. <br>

In the Correa et al (2023) paper, the authors state that “a lot of work is taking place to define the <br>
										values and ideas that should guide AI advances. A key challenge, however, lies in establishing a <br>
										consensus on these values, given the diverse perspectives of various stakeholders worldwide and the <br>
										abstraction of normative discourse. Researchers and policy makers need better tools to catalogue and <br>
										compare AI governance documents from around the world and to identify points of divergence and commonality.” <br>

After reviewing the article and reading how different countries across the world deal with the 
										<br>generative AI revolution, discuss your views on the subject and recommend what you think could be a <br>
										suitable course of action. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this <br>
										study or other relevant literature (additional links to industry have been provided as ‘Other Resources’ <br>
										to the module). Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on <br>
										applicable legal, social and professional issues. Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, <br>
										this exercise is to help you evaluate the legal, social ethical and professional issues that affect computing professionals in industry. <br>

									<p>
										Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys

In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. <br>
										They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). <br>
										This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.<br>
										Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. <br>
										Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply. <br>
